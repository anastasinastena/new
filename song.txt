I got a top hat and a walking cane
I got a black cat on a golden chain
I got a white shirt with a bloody stain
Going to the river of love
She got long hair
And big brown eyes
She belongs there, it was no surprise
Nothing wrong there, she made me realize
We're going to the river of love
We're going down to the river of love
